        <h2 id="section1-heading">Section 1:Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            We are delighted to welcome into our home, and to the beautiful town and surroundings of Aix-les-Bains. 
            The building, a converted former luxury hotel, is in the town’s “hypercentre”. It stands between the central square Place Carnot to its East and the town’s historical Casino Grand Cercle to its West. 
            It is a 5-minute walk (500m) from Aix-les-Bains Le Revard SNCF train station.
Within easy reach of the town centre, you can find yourself swimming in the clear waters of Lac du Bourget, France’s largest and deepest lake or skiing or hiking on the mountains of Le Revard, France’s oldest ski station. 
We hope you will like the town as much as Queen Victoria, who came three times (and stayed a stone’s throw from 301 Le Carnot), the Romans who discovered thermal springs 131 BC and built Baths whose remains can still be seen, or the fast-growing number of French and foreign tourists who visit it at all seasons.  
We have put together this guide to help you get the most out of your time in this wonderful place, and be totally comfortable in the apartment during your stay.
Wishing you a lovely stay!
